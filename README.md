# Project Overview

## Project Name

brewQuery

## Project Description

A simple website that will allow the user to search a catalog of beers from around the world and get information about the beer (e.g. type, ABV, glassware, brewery, and a description of the beer). Website will load up with information and brewery location of a random beer, and allow the user to choose what they want to do from a drop down menu. Menu items will include beer search, finding brewery locations and random beer.
