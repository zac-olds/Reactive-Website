# Project Overview

## Project Name

brewQuery

## Project Description

A simple website that will allow the user to search a catalog of beers from around the world and get information about the beer (e.g. type, ABV, glassware, brewery, description of the beer). Website will load up with information and brewery location of a random beer, and allow the user to choose what they want to do from a drop down menu. Menu items will include beer search, finding brewery locations and random beer.
